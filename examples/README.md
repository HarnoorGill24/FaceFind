# Examples

This folder hosts tiny assets to try **FaceFind** quickly.

## sample_media/
Place a few images or short videos here. Files can be nested in subdirectories and may mix formats.

Example structure:
```
examples/
└── sample_media/
    ├── person_a/
    │   ├── img1.jpg
    │   └── img2.jpg
    └── person_b.jpg
```

For convenience, run the helper script to download two anonymized faces generated by [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com):

```bash
python examples/get_sample_faces.py
```

The downloaded files are synthetic and do not depict real people. Feel free to replace them with your own media.
